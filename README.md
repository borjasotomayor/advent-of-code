# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems. I currently have all my 2020 and 2021 solutions, and I'm slowly cleaning up my 2019 solutions. I'm also doing Advent of Code 2022, and adding solutions as I finish them.

Inside each year's directory, each day has a `dayXX.py` file that will run the code necessary to solve both stars for that day. Each file includes a header with a few comments on the problem.

All solutions are written in Python 3.8 (although most of them should also run fine with Python 3.6). You should be able to run each solution like this:

    $ python3 dayXX.py
