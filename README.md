# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems. I currently have all my 2020-2022 solutions, and I'm slowly cleaning up my 2019 solutions. I'm also doing Advent of Code 2023, and adding solutions as I finish them.

Inside each year's directory, each day has a `dayXX.py` file that will run the code necessary to solve both stars for that day. Each file includes a header with a few comments on the problem.

All solutions are written in Python 3; most code will run with Python 3.8, but some code requires at least Python 3.10. You should be able to run each solution like this:

    $ python3 dayXX.py
